# Mastercard_virtual_intern
As a fresher this was a wholesome experience, completing virtual intern as an Advisor &amp; consulting services.
I just completed Mastercard's Advisors & Consulting Services on Forage. In the simulation I:
Completed a job simulation involving data-driven marketing analysis for Mastercard.
Analyzed a comprehensive data set, employing techniques in statistical analysis and comparative study to identify key trends in sales and customer engagement.
Developed and presented a strategic marketing plan based on data insights, effectively communicating complex data to non-technical stakeholders through clear, engaging narratives and visualizations.
Utilized advanced data analytics tools and software, honing skills in data interpretation, visualization, and presentation, leading to actionable recommendations for enhanced ROI and marketing practices.

Moreover, it felt like a small professional project wherein you have to take care of the communication part as well, that is essential in a corporate setup.
